# React Demo: Random Cocktail

## Description

This represents a speed challenge for me with the following requirements:
* Use React
* Use React Router
* Use Tailwind
* Connect to an external API

In an hour, I accomplished a _very_ basic implementation of the above. The styling is bland, UI is non-existant, and the API cannot be called again. Is it good? No. Did I do it in an hour of actual coding? Yes. Barely.

## So why...?

My career did not include corporate web development in the last decade, when React dominated. (My corporate web development experience was from the aughts and we used PHP on the back end.) I haven't soaked myself in one abstraction framework or another. Instead, I've spent a lifetime deeply learning the underlying systems and best practices of web development, the base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to do nearly anything from scratch. I'm experienced with algorithmic thinking, systems analysis and design, software engineering, and database design, and I have a master's degree in information technology. So, I consider myself a bit more than just a web development specialist. My deeper knowledge helps me learn these abstractions very quickly. Maybe not within an hour, but quickly.
